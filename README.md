Nammu - Runtime Permission Helper
=======
6.0 权限控制
Speed up your work with new Runtime Permissions introduced in Android M. This lib allows you to monitor permissions, check them in background and as well ask for a permission in easy way (callback).

###What are Runtime Permissions?
Google docs is [here](https://developer.android.com/preview/features/runtime-permissions.html).
TLDR: like old-loved permissions that were ask during intallation but this time they are more dynamic (should be ask only when they are needed) and can be revoked by user at any time.

###Why should I care?
Beacause your user can revoke most essential part of your app and quite probably there will be a lot of app crashes.
Current solution you can see here - [Google sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-RuntimePermissions) basically there is a lot that happens with Activity that is used to check and grant permissions. Also permissions rights are checked many times in the code.

###Monitor permissions
To keep track of access to particular permissions, all you need is init Nammu `Nammu.init(Context);` (can be in Application class onCreate or Activity) and call `permissionCompare(PermissionListener)` to compare lists of granted permissions with previous method call. If you want only to update granted permission lists (without checking if anything changed) use `refreshMonitoredList()`. PermissionListener offers a callback when permissions was changed, removed, or added. It is recommended to do on app start to check if user didn't removed any permissions and open our app again.

Also you can add Permission to ignored list to ignore its changes in access - use `ignorePermission(String permission)`.


###Easy asking for permissions
It removes a bit of boiler plate to keep request id, and thus simplify your code inside Activity class.
call `Nammu.askForPermission(Activity, PermissionString , PermissionCallback)` which offers a nice callback with either succes or fail method. To use this only thing you need to add is in your Activity that you are using.

```java
@Override
public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions, int[] grantResults) {
    Nammu.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
}
```

###Extras
You can get list of monitored Persmissions -`Nammu.getPrevPermissions()`, list of currently granted permissions - `getGrantedPermissions()`, and few less important.

###How to import it?
As for now it is not hosted at Maven/JCenter etc. ~~as it is based on preview build of Android M which SDK is not available on those platforms~~ I will upload as soon as I will be sure that current version is stable. Till that time, it is available on jitpack.io by adding this to your build.gradle:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://jitpack.io"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.tajchert:nammu:1.1.1'
}
```
Kudos to Jitpack.io for installing M preview SDK for us([link](https://github.com/tajchert/Nammu/pull/1))!
